# Monthly-HR-Dashboard---Power-BI
Analyzing key employee metrics and trends. The dashboard provided the following insights:

1️⃣ Breakdown of staff by job roles
2️⃣ Gender distribution across the organization
3️⃣ Age spread of employees
4️⃣ Jobs with the highest pay
5️⃣ Top earners in each role
6️⃣ Qualification vs. salary analysis
7️⃣ Staff growth trends over time
8️⃣ Employee filtering by name's starting letter
9️⃣ Leave balance analysis

Through this project, I utilized advanced data analysis techniques to visualize and interpret HR data, offering clear insights for decision-making and workforce planning.

Project Learning: 
1) Loading data into Power BI and cleaning it with Power Query.
2) Creating HR metrics like headcount, avg. leave balance, avg. salary etc. with Power Pivot.
3) Adding columns to the data (like Employee's first name, age group etc.)
4) Finding relationships between salary and education qualification.
5) Using visual filters to see top 3 paid staff in each job.
6) Customizing visuals in Power BI (changing colours, axis, labels and legend)
7) Advanced DAX calculations like cumulative headcount, leave balance more than 20 days.
8) Designing a monthly HR dashboard with Power BI.
9) Working with "NEW" card visual in Power BI.
